              My husband and I both have digestive issues and Dr. Duhl has taken
            excellent care of us for several years. On one visit he detected
            something amiss with me and had me go to the hospital immediately.
            The issue was not related to my digestive problem. He was looking
            after the whole person! He is a keeper.

            Dr. Duhl is a great physician and a top class specialist. He's kind,
            caring, and invested in the health of his patients. There's always a
            plan that he has to address the issue at hand. His staff are always
            pleasant and easy to work with. I have experienced long wait times
            in the past, but it's easy to overlook because of the care you
            receive. All in all the best you can ask for in a doctor and a true
            professional in treating the illness.

            If I could give him 1000 stars I would. A true gentleman and
            somebody that cares about his patients. Did for me what 3 doctors
            couldn't/didn't want to and had all the patience and respect in the
            world. Amazing person.

            This provider will make sure that you are taken care of on the inside as well as the outside. I left with everything I needed to follow up on my condition. I also was contacted by Quest as a reminder that my provider ordered blood work, etc. I appreciate the care I receive as well as the reminders!

            He was very attentive and careful with my concerns and came up with a plan of action to figure out the problem and determine solutions from that point forward. He seemed to understand exactly what I was worried about before I even said it.

            Dr. Duhl and his staff are absolutely wonderful! Dr. Duhl listens to every concern and explains in detail the plan of treatment. I highly recommend Dr.Duhl not only because he is so knowledgeable in his field with new updated treatments available but he gives options to treatments. He and his staff are very down to earth !

            While the wait was long, as others have mentioned, I think it was well worth the wait! The wait time is understandable when you take into consideration that he gives each individual patient his undivided attention. We spoke, in length, about my concerns. I did not feel rushed, at any point. Dr. Duhl is personable and professional. He made me feel at ease and really LISTENED. I also appreciated the printout he dictated stating my assessment and treatment or "homework" as he calls it.
